## Courses completed for the Associate Degree in Computer Science

### Programming Fundamentals | CS 1101
This course covers the basics of computer programming and provides a foundation for further learning in this area. No previous computer programming knowledge is required to finish this course. The course uses the Python programming language which is very simple and straightforward. The course also covers abstract concepts which can be applied to almost any programming language, and students are encouraged to pay attention to these, since the way of thinking like a programmer is the most valuable lesson they will learn.

### Programming 1 | CS 1102
This introductory course teaches the fundamental concepts of programming languages by use of the popular Java language. The topics cover fundamental principles of programming, including data types, program control and decisions, loops, string manipulations, procedures, arrays, software testing, and debugging.

### Databases 1 | CS 2203
This course introduces the fundamental concepts necessary for designing, using and implementing database systems. We stress the fundamentals of database modeling and design, relational theory, and the Structured Query Language.

### Programming 2 | CS 1103
This course builds on the Introduction to Programming 1 course and teaches a more highly developed Java programming language with features beyond the basic concepts covered in the first programming course. A large part of the course will be devoted to more advanced building blocks such as recursion, linked data structures, and Java's Collection Framework. In addition to this, students learn about designing and coding complex, robust, and efficient programs, and are introduced to a professional programming tool: the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment.
